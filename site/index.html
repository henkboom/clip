<h1>clip: cart 498f prototype project</h1>
<p>a 10-second "video" game prototype by <a href="http://henk.ca/">Henk Boom
</a></p>
<h2>the game</h2>
<p>The controls are presented in-game, but just in case you missed them, arrow
keys left and right to move, up to jump. You can drag the timeline to turn back
(or forward) time. One tip for getting across large gaps: if you repeatedly
jump while moving in one direction without stopping, each jump goes farther
than the last.</p>
<h2>concept</h2>
<p>The concept was to make a game that played like a youtube video. The video
lasts 10 seconds, after which it stops. However, you can rewind or fast forward
the video by moving the timeline. Currently this is useful for undoing
mistakes, but many other things are possible.</p>
<h2>future directions</h2>
<p>Other than just extending the game, it would be interesting to look into
what other elements of streaming video could be taken advantage of. For
example, it would be interesting to add buffering as a gameplay mechanic.
Instead of having access to the whole 10 seconds of the clip, only the first 4
would buffer, and you have to collect data packets to extend it, racing to get
them before you run out of time. The exit and some of the data packets would be
too far away to reach in four seconds, so you'd have to plan in what order to
pick them up to maximize your chances of reaching the exit.</p>
<p>The speed relationship between jumping and walking makes for fun movement, and it would be fun to take advantage of that with larger environments.</p>
<h2>what happened?</h2>
<p>The other students in CART 498f might be surprised at this project, since
it's so different from the earlier concepts I showed in class. I had an
ambitious plan (posted
<a href="http://stuff.henk.ca/cart498f/schedule.xhtml">here</a>), which I'd put
a lot of time into, and was pretty excited about. Over time, as I kept adding
features, I started to feel like the game wasn't focused enough, it didn't
have a SOUL of its own. I started to feel like even if I finished everything
that I wanted to put in, I would end up with a piece of software which wasn't
interesting, just full of features.</p>
<p>In order to jump-start my motivation again, I decided to go back to the
beginning, and come up with a small, focused concept, maybe similar or maybe
different. I eventually came up with what's above, but the limited time left I
was restricted to making a prototype, not a fully developed game. Still, it's
a successful prototype in that it prompted new ideas.</p>
